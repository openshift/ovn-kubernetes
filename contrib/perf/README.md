## Workloads
### kubelet-density-cni
This simple workload launches a webserver, service and a curl client within a namespace.

For our use-case we make some modifications to the base config shipped with kube-burner.

```
  - name: kubelet-density-cni
    jobIterations: 100
    qps: 10
    burst: 10
    namespacedIterations: false
    namespace: kubelet-density-cni
    waitWhenFinished: true
    podWait: false
    preLoadImages: true
    preLoadPeriod: 2m
    churnConfig:
      percent: 10
      cycles: 10
      mode: objects
```

We enable churn, which will delete and recreate the objects we created in the namespace. We also lower the QPS to 10/10 since
we are testing on a kind cluster.

### udn-density-l2-noPods / cudn-density-l2-noPods
These workloads create UDN (UserDefinedNetwork) or CUDN (ClusterUserDefinedNetwork) L2 network objects without any pods.

### udn-density-l2-pods
This workload creates UDN L2 networks along with client pods.

### cudn-density-l2-pods-netpol / udn-density-l2-pods-netpol / udn-density-l3-pods-netpol
These workloads create UDN or CUDN networks (L2 or L3) along with server deployments, client deployments, services, and network policies (deny-all + allow-from-clients).

## Test Reporting Locally.

Generate a GH Token :

`$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)`

List some of the recent PRs that have had the performance workload :

`$ gh run list --workflow performance-test.yml --limit 5`

Pick from the list and run the end to end script.

`$ bash test-full-workflow.sh 25505803912`
