#### EgressIPSpec



EgressIPSpec is a desired state description of EgressIP.



_Appears in:_
- [EgressIP](#egressip)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `egressIPs` _string array_ | EgressIPs is the list of egress IP addresses requested. Can be IPv4 and/or IPv6.<br />This field is mandatory. |  |  |
| `namespaceSelector` _[LabelSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#labelselector-v1-meta)_ | NamespaceSelector applies the egress IP only to the namespace(s) whose label<br />matches this definition. This field is mandatory. |  |  |
| `podSelector` _[LabelSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#labelselector-v1-meta)_ | PodSelector applies the egress IP only to the pods whose label<br />matches this definition. This field is optional, and in case it is not set:<br />results in the egress IP being applied to all pods in the namespace(s)<br />matched by the NamespaceSelector. In case it is set: is intersected with<br />the NamespaceSelector, thus applying the egress IP to the pods<br />(in the namespace(s) already matched by the NamespaceSelector) which<br />match this pod selector. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `egressNodeSelector` _[LabelSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#labelselector-v1-meta)_ | EgressNodeSelector limits the pool of nodes that can host the<br />EgressIPs in this object; it applies to all EgressIPs in this object.<br />Only nodes whose labels match this selector are eligible for assignment.<br />This field is optional. When not specified by the user, the CRD<br />default is applied: \{matchExpressions: [\{key:<br />k8s.ovn.org/egress-assignable, operator: Exists\}]\}.<br />An empty selector (\{\}) matches all nodes in the cluster including<br />control plane nodes — use with caution as it expands the eligible<br />node pool and health-check set to the entire cluster.<br />This field restricts only where the IPs in this EgressIP object are<br />placed; it does not reserve the matched nodes for exclusive use.<br />Other EgressIP objects can still consume capacity on the same nodes. | \{ matchExpressions:[map[key:k8s.ovn.org/egress-assignable operator:Exists]] \} | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### EgressIPStatus







_Appears in:_
- [EgressIP](#egressip)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `items` _[EgressIPStatusItem](#egressipstatusitem) array_ | The list of assigned egress IPs and their corresponding node assignment. |  |  |


#### EgressIPStatusItem



The per node status, for those egress IPs who have been assigned.



_Appears in:_
- [EgressIPStatus](#egressipstatus)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `node` _string_ | Assigned node name |  |  |
| `egressIP` _string_ | Assigned egress IP |  |  |
