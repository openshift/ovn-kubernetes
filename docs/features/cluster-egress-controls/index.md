# Cluster Egress Controls

Control how traffic leaves the cluster with EgressIP, EgressService, and EgressQoS.

**[EgressIP](egress-ip.md)**

Assign stable, predictable source IPs to egress traffic from selected pods.

**[EgressService](egress-service.md)**

Route egress traffic from pods through a Service's load balancer IP.

**[EgressQoS](egress-qos.md)**

Apply DSCP marking rules to egress traffic on a per-namespace basis.

**[EgressGateway](egress-gateway.md)**

Direct egress traffic through designated gateway nodes using policy-based routing.
