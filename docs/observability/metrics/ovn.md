# OVN metrics

OVN-Kubernetes collects metrics from ovn-controller, ovn-northd, and the OVN
northbound and southbound databases. Only the `coverage/show` and
stopwatch/show` entries selected by OVN-Kubernetes, along with separately
collected database, build, status, connection, and configuration metrics, are exported.

Coverage values are represented as Prometheus gauges, although the underlying
OVN events are cumulative. Stopwatch duration statistics are gauges expressed
in seconds; only `total_samples` is a count. A failed collection can leave the
previous value in place. An event that has never occurred is reported as zero.

## OVN Database Metrics

The `db_name` label is the database schema name, such as `OVN_Northbound` or
`OVN_Southbound`. The database size family is registered only when the
database files can be found.

All metrics in this section are rooted at `ovn_db_`.

| Name | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build_info` | Gauge | `version`, `nb_schema_version`, `sb_schema_version` | ovsdb-server and OVN schema version information. The value is always `1`. |
| `jsonrpc_server_sessions` | Gauge | `db_name` | Active JSON-RPC server sessions. |
| `ovsdb_monitors` | Gauge | `db_name` | OVSDB monitors running on the server. |
| `db_size_bytes` | Gauge | `db_name` | Size of the database file. |
| `e2e_timestamp` | Gauge | `db_name` | Unix timestamp observed in each database for the end-to-end freshness check. |

## OVN Controller Metrics

All metrics in this section are rooted at `ovn_controller_`.

### Build, Status, and Configuration

| Name | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build_info` | Gauge | `version`, `ovs_lib_version` | OVN and Open vSwitch library version information. The value is always `1`. |
| `southbound_database_connected` | Gauge | None | Whether ovn-controller is connected to the southbound database: `1` for connected and `0` otherwise. |
| `remote_probe_interval_seconds` | Gauge | None | Inactivity probe interval for the southbound database connection. |
| `openflow_probe_interval_seconds` | Gauge | None | Inactivity probe interval for the integration bridge OpenFlow connection. |
| `monitor_all` | Gauge | None | Whether ovn-controller monitors all southbound records: `1` for true and `0` for false. |
| `encap_ip` | Gauge | `ipaddress` | Configured encapsulation IP. The active label set has value `1`. |
| `encap_type` | Gauge | `type` | Configured encapsulation type. The active label set has value `1`. |
| `sb_connection_method` | Gauge | `connection_method` | Configured southbound connection method. The active label set has value `1`. |
| `bridge_mappings` | Gauge | `mapping` | Configured physical-network-to-bridge mappings. The active label set has value `1`. |
| `integration_bridge_openflow_total` | Gauge | None | Point-in-time number of OpenFlow flows on the integration bridge. Despite the `_total` suffix, this is not a counter. |
| `integration_bridge_patch_ports` | Gauge | None | Patch ports connecting the integration bridge to physical or local bridges. |
| `integration_bridge_geneve_ports` | Gauge | None | Geneve ports on the integration bridge. |

The `ovnkube_controller_udn_nbdb_programmed_duration_seconds` histogram is
documented with the other [ovnkube-controller metrics](ovnkube-node.md#scale-metrics).

### Stopwatch Metrics

For every base name below, OVN-Kubernetes exports these six gauge families:

- `<base>_total_samples`
- `<base>_maximum`
- `<base>_minimum`
- `<base>_95th_percentile`
- `<base>_short_term_avg`
- `<base>_long_term_avg`

`total_samples` is a sample count. The other five values are durations in
seconds.

| `flow_installation` | Flow installation |
| `if_status_mgr_run` | Interface status manager run loop |

| `ofctrl_seqno_run` | OpenFlow controller sequence-number run loop |
| `patch_run` | Patch-port processing loop |
| `ct_zone_commit` | Connection-tracking zone commit |

## OVN Northd Metrics
