# OVN-Kubernetes node metrics

This page documents metrics produced by ovnkube-controller, ovnkube-node, and
their libovsdb clients. Metrics collected from the OVN and OVS daemons are
listed separately in the [OVN](ovn.md) and [Open vSwitch](ovs.md) catalogs.

These metrics are registered only when
`--metrics-enable-config-duration` is enabled. They report an upper bound:
unrelated work and the slowest node may increase a measurement.
