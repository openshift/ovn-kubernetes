# Open vSwitch metrics

OVN-Kubernetes collects metrics from ovs-vswitchd and the Open_vSwitch
database. These metrics are available on Linux when OVS metrics export is
enabled.

OVS `coverage/show` values are exposed as Prometheus gauges even though the
underlying events are cumulative. Daemon restarts can reset them. A failed
collection can leave the previous value in place, while an event that has
never occurred is reported as zero.

## Open vSwitch Metrics

All metrics in this section are rooted at `ovs_`.

| Name | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build_info` | Gauge | `version` | Open vSwitch version information. The value is always `1`. |

## OVS Vswitchd Metrics

All metrics in this section are rooted at `ovs_vswitchd_`.

### Datapath Metrics

Several cumulative datapath statistics are gauges because they are snapshots
read from OVS.

| Name | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dp_total` | Gauge | None | Number of datapaths. |
| `dp` | Gauge | `datapath`, `type` | Datapath identity. Each present datapath has value `1`. |
| `dp_if_total` | Gauge | `datapath` | Ports connected to a datapath. |
| `dp_flows_total` | Gauge | `datapath` | Current flows in a datapath. |
| `dp_flows_lookup_hit` | Gauge | `datapath` | Packets that matched an existing datapath flow. |
| `dp_flows_lookup_missed` | Gauge | `datapath` | Packets that missed existing datapath flows and required userspace processing. |
| `dp_flows_lookup_lost` | Gauge | `datapath` | Missed packets dropped before reaching userspace. |
| `dp_packets_total` | Gauge | `datapath` | Sum of datapath lookup hits and misses. |
| `dp_masks_hit` | Gauge | `datapath` | Masks visited while matching packets. |
| `dp_masks_total` | Gauge | `datapath` | Masks in a datapath. |

### Bridge Metrics

| Name | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bridge_total` | Gauge | None | Number of OVS bridges. |
| `bridge` | Gauge | `bridge` | Bridge identity. Each present bridge has value `1`. |
| `bridge_ports_total` | Gauge | `bridge` | Ports on a bridge. |
| `bridge_flows_total` | Gauge | `bridge` | Current OpenFlow flows on a bridge. |

### Interface Metrics

These metrics do not provide per-interface statistics. The error and reset
families aggregate cumulative OVSDB interface statistics across all interfaces
on the node and are represented as gauges.

| Name | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `interfaces_total` | Gauge | None | Number of Open vSwitch interfaces. |
| `interface_resets_total` | Gauge | None | Link-state changes observed across interfaces. |
| `interface_rx_dropped_total` | Gauge | None | Received packets dropped across interfaces. |
| `interface_tx_dropped_total` | Gauge | None | Transmitted packets dropped across interfaces. |
| `interface_rx_errors_total` | Gauge | None | Receive errors across interfaces. |
| `interface_tx_errors_total` | Gauge | None | Transmit errors across interfaces. |
| `interface_collisions_total` | Gauge | None | Transmit collisions across interfaces. |
| `interface_up_wait_seconds_total` | Counter | None | Cumulative time spent waiting for pod OVS interfaces to become available. |

### Thread and Hardware-Offload Metrics

| Name | Type | Labels | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `handlers_total` | Gauge | None | Number of handler threads that process datapath upcalls. |
| `revalidators_total` | Gauge | None | Number of threads that revalidate datapath flows. |
| `hw_offload` | Gauge | None | Whether hardware flow offload is enabled: `1` for enabled and `0` otherwise. |
| `tc_policy` | Gauge | None | TC offload policy: `0` none, `1` `skip_sw`, and `2` `skip_hw`. |

### Coverage Metrics

| `netlink_received` | Gauge | Netlink messages received from the kernel. |
| `netlink_recv_jumbo` | Gauge | Netlink messages larger than the allocated receive buffer. |
| `netlink_overflow` | Gauge | Netlink messages dropped because the daemon buffer overflowed. |
| `rconn_sent` | Gauge | Messages sent on reliable OpenFlow connections. |

## Prometheus Process Collector Metrics

When OVN-Kubernetes is not running in unprivileged mode
(`!config.UnprivilegedMode`), it registers Prometheus process collectors for
ovs-vswitchd and ovsdb-server. These metrics are provided by the
[Prometheus Go client process collector](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/main/prometheus/process_collector.go),
not defined by OVN-Kubernetes.

The ovs-vswitchd families are rooted at `ovs_vswitchd_`, and the ovsdb-server
families are rooted at `ovs_db_`. The available families are defined by the
Prometheus Go client and may vary with its version or the platform. Refer to
the linked process collector source for the current list.
