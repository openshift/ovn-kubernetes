## DPU support

With the emergence of [Data Processing Units](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/20/whats-a-dpu-data-processing-unit/) (DPUs), 
NIC vendors can now offer greater hardware acceleration capability, flexibility and security. 

It is desirable to leverage DPU in OVN-kubernetes to accelerate networking and secure the network control plane.

A DPU consists of:
- Industry-standard, high-performance, software-programmable multi-core CPU
- High-performance network interface
- Flexible and programmable acceleration engines

Similarly to Smart-NICs, a DPU follows the kernel switchdev model.
In this model, every VF/PF net-device on the host has a corresponding representor net-device existing
on the embedded CPU.

Any vendor that manufactures a DPU which supports the above model should work with current design.
