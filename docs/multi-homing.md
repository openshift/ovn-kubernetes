# Multi-homing
A K8s pod with more than one network interface is said to be multi-homed. The
[Network Plumbing Working Group](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multi-net-spec)
has put forward a [standard](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multi-net-spec)
describing how to specify the configurations for additional network interfaces.

There are several delegating plugins or meta-plugins (Multus, Genie)
implementing this standard.

After a pod is scheduled on a particular Kubernetes node, kubelet will invoke
the delegating plugin to prepare the pod for networking. This meta-plugin will
then invoke the CNI responsible for setting up the pod's default cluster
network, and afterwards it iterates the list of additional attachments on the
pod, invoking the corresponding delegate CNI implementing the logic to attach
the pod to that particular network.

## Configuring secondary networks
To allow pods to have multiple network interfaces, the user must provide the
configurations specifying how to connect to these networks; these
configurations are defined in a CRD named `NetworkAttachmentDefinition`.

Below you will find example attachment configurations for each of the current
topologies OVN-K allows for secondary networks.

**NOTE**:
- networks are **not** namespaced - i.e. creating multiple
  `network-attachment-definition`s with different configurations pointing at the
  same network (same `NetConf.Name` attribute) is **not** supported.

### Routed - layer 3 - topology
This topology is a simplification of the topology for the cluster default
network - but without egress.

There is a logical switch per node - each with a different subnet - and a
router interconnecting all the logical switches.

The following net-attach-def configures the attachment to a routed secondary
network.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: l3-network
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  config: |2
    {
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
            "name": "l3-network",
            "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay",
            "topology":"layer3",
            "subnets": "10.128.0.0/16/24",
            "mtu": 1300,
            "netAttachDefName": "ns1/l3-network"
    }
```

#### Network Configuration reference
- `name` (string, required): the name of the network. This attribute is **not** namespaced.
- `type` (string, required): "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay".
- `topology` (string, required): "layer3".
- `subnets` (string, required): a comma separated list of subnets. When multiple subnets
  are provided, the user will get an IP from each subnet.
- `mtu` (integer, optional): explicitly set MTU to the specified value. Defaults to the value chosen by the kernel.
- `netAttachDefName` (string, required): must match `<namespace>/<net-attach-def name>`
  of the surrounding object.

**NOTE**
- the `subnets` attribute indicates both the subnet across the cluster, and per node.
  The example above means you have a /16 subnet for the network, but each **node** has
  a /24 subnet.
- routed - layer3 - topology networks **only** allow for east/west traffic.

### Switched - layer 2 - topology
This topology interconnects the workloads via a cluster-wide logical switch.

The following net-attach-def configures the attachment to a layer 2 secondary
network.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: l2-network
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  config: |2
    {
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
            "name": "l2-network",
            "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay",
            "topology":"layer2",
            "subnets": "10.100.200.0/24",
            "mtu": 1300,
            "netAttachDefName": "ns1/l2-network",
            "excludeSubnets": "10.100.200.0/29"
    }
```

#### Network Configuration reference
- `name` (string, required): the name of the network. This attribute is **not** namespaced.
- `type` (string, required): "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay".
- `topology` (string, required): "layer2".
  `subnets` (string, optional): a comma separated list of subnets. When multiple subnets
  are provided, the user will get an IP from each subnet.
- `mtu` (integer, optional): explicitly set MTU to the specified value. Defaults to the value chosen by the kernel.
- `netAttachDefName` (string, required): must match `<namespace>/<net-attach-def name>`
  of the surrounding object.
- `excludeSubnets` (string, optional): a comma separated list of CIDRs / IPs.
  These IPs will be removed from the assignable IP pool, and never handed over
  to the pods.

**NOTE**
- when the subnets attribute is omitted, the logical switch implementing the
  network will only provide layer 2 communication, and the users must configure
  IPs for the pods. Port security will only prevent MAC spoofing.
- switched - layer2 - secondary networks **only** allow for east/west traffic.
- this topology is not supported when Interconnect feature is enabled with multiple zones.

### Switched - localnet - topology
This topology interconnects the workloads via a cluster-wide logical switch to
a physical network.

The following net-attach-def configures the attachment to a localnet secondary
network.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: localnet-network
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  config: |2
    {
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
            "name": "localnet-network",
            "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay",
            "topology":"localnet",
            "subnets": "202.10.130.112/28",
            "vlanID": 33,
            "mtu": 1500,
            "netAttachDefName": "ns1/localnet-network"
    }
```

Note that in order to connect to the physical network, it is expected that
ovn-bridge-mappings is configured appropriately on the chassis for this
localnet network.

#### Network Configuration reference
- `name` (string, required): the name of the network.
- `type` (string, required): "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay".
- `topology` (string, required): "localnet".
- `subnets` (string, optional): a comma separated list of subnets. When multiple subnets
  are provided, the user will get an IP from each subnet.
- `mtu` (integer, optional): explicitly set MTU to the specified value. Defaults to the value chosen by the kernel.
- `netAttachDefName` (string, required): must match `<namespace>/<net-attach-def name>`
  of the surrounding object.
- `excludeSubnets` (string, optional): a comma separated list of CIDRs / IPs.
  These IPs will be removed from the assignable IP pool, and never handed over
  to the pods.
- `vlanID` (integer, optional): assign VLAN tag. Defaults to none.

**NOTE**
- when the subnets attribute is omitted, the logical switch implementing the
  network will only provide layer 2 communication, and the users must configure
  IPs for the pods. Port security will only prevent MAC spoofing.
- this topology is not supported when Interconnect feature is enabled with multiple zones.

## Pod configuration
The user must specify the secondary network attachments via the
`k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation.

The following example provisions a pod with two secondary attachments, one for
each of the attachment configurations presented in
[Configuring secondary networks](#configuring-secondary-networks).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: l3-network,l2-network
  name: tinypod
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - pause
    image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.36
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: agnhost-container
```

### Setting static IP addresses on a pod
The user can specify attachment parameters via
[network-selection-elements](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/blob/63033d5c63d1cf56f924a5454c8f2ac444b6736d/pkg/apis/k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1/types.go#L137)
, namely IP, MAC, and interface name.

Refer to the following yaml for an example on how to request a static IP for a
pod, a MAC address, and specify the pod interface name.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: '[
      {
        "name": "l2-network",
        "mac": "02:03:04:05:06:07",
        "interface": "myiface1",
        "ips": [
          "192.0.2.20/24"
        ]
      }
    ]'
  name: tinypod
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - pause
    image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.36
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: agnhost-container
```

**NOTE:**
- the user can specify the IP address for a pod's secondary attachment
  **only** for an L2 or localnet attachment.
- specifying a static IP address for the pod is only possible when the
  attachment configuration does **not** feature subnets.

## Multi-network Policies
OVN-Kubernetes implements native support for
[multi-networkpolicy](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multi-networkpolicy),
an API providing
[network policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
features for secondary networks.

To configure pod isolation, the user must:
- provision a `network-attachment-definition`.
- provision a `MultiNetworkPolicy` indicating to which secondary networks it
  applies via the
  [policy-for](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multi-networkpolicy#policy-for-annotation)
  annotation.

**NOTE:** the `OVN_MULTI_NETWORK_ENABLE` config flag must be enabled.

Please refer to the following example:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: tenant-blue
spec:
    config: '{
        "cniVersion": "0.4.0",
        "name": "tenant-blue",
        "netAttachDefName": "default/tenant-blue",
        "topology": "layer2",
        "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay",
        "subnets": "192.168.100.0/24"
    }'
---
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for: default/tenant-blue # indicates the net-attach-defs this policy applies to
  name: allow-ports-same-ns
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: stuff-doer # the policy will **apply** to all pods with this label
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - port: 9000
      protocol: TCP
    from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: trusted # only pods on namespaces with this label will be allowed on port 9000
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
```

Please note the `MultiNetworkPolicy` has the **exact same** API of the native
`networking.k8s.io/v1` `NetworkPolicy`object; check its documentation for more
information.

**Note:** `net-attach-def`s referred to by the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for`
annotation without the subnet attribute defined are possible if the policy
**only features** `ipBlock` peers. If the `net-attach-def` features the
`subnet` attribute, it can also feature `namespaceSelectors` and `podSelectors`.

## Limitations
OVN-K currently does **not** support:
- the same attachment configured multiple times in the same pod - i.e.
  `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: l3-network,l3-network` is invalid.
- updates to the network selection elements lists - i.e. `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation
- layer2 and localnet secondary networks when Interconnect feature is enabled with multiple zones.
