# AGENTS.md — OVN-Kubernetes

Project context for AI coding agents. See [agents.md](https://agents.md/) for the open standard.

## Project Overview

OVN-Kubernetes is a network plugin written according to CNI Spec that provides
networking for Kubernetes clusters with Open Virtual Network (OVN) and
Open vSwitch (OVS) at its core.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pod Networking | Pod-to-pod connectivity via OVN logical switches and routers |
| IPAM | IP address management for pods and networks |
| Services | Kubernetes Services implemented as OVN load balancers |
| Endpoint Slices | Scalable endpoint tracking for services |
| NetworkPolicy | Kubernetes NetworkPolicy enforcement via OVN ACLs |
| AdminNetworkPolicy | Cluster-scoped network policy (ANP/BANP) |
| EgressIP | Source IP control for egress traffic |
| EgressFirewall | Egress traffic filtering rules |
| EgressService | Egress traffic routing through services |
| EgressQoS | QoS marking on egress traffic |
| Multi-Egress Gateway | Egress traffic via multiple gateway nodes |
| User Defined Networks | Multi-network support, network segmentation (UDN) |
| Cluster Network Connect | Connecting isolated User Defined Networks together for controlled inter-UDN connectivity |
| Multi-Homing | Pods attached to multiple networks |
| DPU/SmartNIC Offload | Hardware acceleration via OVS offload |
| Multicast | IGMP snooping and relay via OVN |
| NetworkQoS | DSCP marking and traffic shaping |
| BGP | Route advertisements and peering |
| EVPN | Ethernet VPN integration |
| No-Overlay | Direct pod routing using BGP-learned routes, without encapsulation |
| KubeVirt | VM live migration and persistent IPs support |
| Hybrid Overlay | Mixed Windows/Linux clusters via VXLAN |

```

## Build and Test

```bash
cd go-controller/
make build          # Build ovnkube binaries
make lint           # Format and lint Go code (required before PR)
make test           # Run unit tests
```

E2E tests run via CI on Kind clusters. See `test/e2e/` for Ginkgo test suites.
To run E2E locally, first set up a Kind cluster using `contrib/kind.sh`, then run the tests.
See `docs/developer-guide/local_testing_guide.md` for more details.

## OKEPs (Enhancement Proposals)

New features require an OKEP in `docs/okeps/`. See `docs/okeps/okep-4368-template.md` for the
template. OKEPs must have an associated GitHub issue, cover all template sections and update
`mkdocs.yml`.

## Architecture Notes

The OVN-Kubernetes plugin watches the Kubernetes API. It acts on the generated Kubernetes
cluster events by creating and configuring the corresponding OVN logical constructs in the
OVN database for those events. OVN (which is an abstraction on top of Open vSwitch) converts
these logical constructs into logical flows in its database and programs the OpenFlow flows
on the node, which enables networking on a Kubernetes cluster.

See [Architecture](docs/design/architecture.md) for component details (ovnkube-control-plane,
ovnkube-node, ovs-node pods and their containers).

### Gateway Modes

OVN-Kubernetes supports two gateway modes that affect how traffic enters and
leaves the cluster:
- **Local gateway (lgw)** — Traffic leaving the pod to go outside the cluster leaves the OVN stack
  and enters the host networking stack via the management port (mp-X) and then based on routes on
  the host, it either leaves via breth0/primary node NIC or via other interfaces on the host. This
  mode uses nftables to implement a lot of the service traffic and since traffic leaves the OVN/OVS
  datapath, it is not hardware offloadable.
- **Shared gateway (sgw)** — Traffic leaving the pod to go outside the cluster stays within the
  OVN/OVS datapath. It goes from the pod through the OVN logical switch, to the Gateway Router
  (GR), and out via the OVS bridge (breth0) directly. This mode is hardware offloadable to DPUs/SmartNICs.

To determine which mode a cluster is using, check the `k8s.ovn.org/l3-gateway-config`
annotation on any node — the `mode` field will be `"local"` or `"shared"`.
Shared gateway is the default.
