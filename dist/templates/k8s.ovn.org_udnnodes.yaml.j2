                  JoinSubnets are used inside the OVN network topology.

                  Dual-stack clusters may set 2 subnets (one for each IP family), otherwise only 1 subnet is allowed.
                  This field is only allowed for "Primary" network.
                  It is not recommended to set this field without explicit need and understanding of the OVN network topology.
                  When omitted, the platform will choose a reasonable default which is subject to change over time.
