          EgressFirewall describes the current egress firewall for a Namespace.
          Traffic from a pod to an IP address outside the cluster will be checked against
          each EgressFirewallRule in the pod's namespace's EgressFirewall, in
          order. If no rule matches (or no EgressFirewall is present) then the traffic
          will be allowed by default.
