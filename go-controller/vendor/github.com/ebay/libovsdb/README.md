An OVSDB Library written in Go

## Purpose of Fork of Original libovsdb

eBay wishes to thank the original authors of libovsdb. The original library is
found here:

https://github.com/socketplane/libovsdb/

This fork has been created to encourage changes and patches to ensure this
version of the library works with [go-ovn](https://github.com/eBay/go-ovn).

## What is OVSDB?

OVSDB is the Open vSwitch Database Protocol.
It's defined in [RFC 7047](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047)
It's used mainly for managing the configuration of Open vSwitch, but it could also be used to manage your stamp collection. Philatelists Rejoice!

##Â Running the tests

To run integration tests, you'll need access to docker to run an Open vSwitch container.
Mac users can use [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io)

    export DOCKER_IP=$(boot2docker ip)

    docker-compose run test /bin/sh
    # make test-local
    ...
    # exit
    docker-compose down

By invoking the command **make**, you will automatically get the same behaviour as what
is shown above. In other words, it will start the two containers and execute
**make test-local** from the test container.

## Dependency Management

We use [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) for dependency management with rewritten import paths.
This allows the repo to be `go get`able.

To bump the version of a dependency, follow these [instructions](https://github.com/tools/godep#update-a-dependency)
